Background Music
======================

In addition to programming the PiCar-X to play sound effects or text-to-speech (TTS), the PiCar-X will also play background music. This project will also use a **Slider** widget for adjusting the music volume.

**TIPS**

The **play background music** block will need to be added to the **Start** function. Use the drop-down menu to choose different background music for the PiCar-X to play.
