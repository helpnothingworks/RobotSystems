Minecart Plus
=======================

In this project, derailment recovery has been added to the :ref:`ezb_minecart` project to let the PiCar-X adapt and recover from a more severe curve.

**TIPS**

#. Use another **to do something** block to allow the PiCar-X to back up and recover from a sharp curve. Note that the new **to do something** function does not return any values, but is used just for reorienting the PiCar-X.

#. **Set ref to ()** block is used to set the grayscale threshold, you need to modify it according to the actual situation. You can go ahead and run :ref:`test_grayscale` to see the values of the grayscale module on the white and black surfaces, and fill in their middle values in this block.


**EXAMPLE**

.. note::

    * You can write the program according to the following picture, please refer to the tutorial: :ref:`ezblock:create_project_latest`.
