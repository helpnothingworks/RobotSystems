Sound Effect
===============================

PiCar-X has a built-in speaker that can be used for audio experiments. Ezblock allows users to enter text to make the PiCar-X speak, or make specific sound effects. In this tutorial, the PiCar-X will make the sound of a gun firing after a 3-second countdown, using a do/while function.

**TIPS**

Use the **say** block with a **text** block to write a sentence for the PiCar-X to say. The **say** block can be used with text or numbers.

The **number** block.

Using the **repeat** block will repeatedly execute the same statement, which reduces the size of the code.

The **mathematical operation** block can perform typical mathematical functions, such as ‚Äù+‚Äù, ‚Äú-‚Äù, ‚Äúx‚Äù, and ‚Äú√∑ ‚Äú.

The play **sound effects - with volume - %** block has preset sound effects, such as a siren sound, a gun sound, and others. The range of the volume can be set from 0 to 100.
