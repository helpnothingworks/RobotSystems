Test Grayscale Module
==============================

PiCar-X includes a Grayscale module for implementing line-following, cliff detection, and other fun experiments. The Grayscale module has three detection sensors that will each report a value according to the shade of color detected by the sensor. For example, a sensor reading the shade of pure black will return a value of ‚Äú0‚Äù.

**TIPS**

Use the **Grayscale module** block to read the value of one of the sensors. In the example above, the ‚ÄúA0‚Äù sensor is the sensor on the far left of the PiCar-X. Use the drop-down arrow to change the sensor to ‚ÄúA1‚Äù (center sensor), or ‚ÄúA2‚Äù (far right sensor).

The program is simplified with a **create list with** block. 
A **List** is used in the same way as a single **Variable**, 
but in this case a **List** is more efficient than a single **Variable** because the **Grayscale module** will be reporting more than one sensor value.
The **create list with** block will create separate **Variables** for each sensor, and put them into a List.

**EXAMPLE**

.. note::

    * You can write the program according to the following picture, please refer to the tutorial: :ref:`ezblock:create_project_latest`.
    * Or find the code with the same name on the **Examples** page of the EzBlock Studio and click **Run** or **Edit** directly.
