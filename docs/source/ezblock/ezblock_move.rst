Move
============

This first project teaches how to program movement actions for the PiCar-X. In this project, the program will tell the PiCar-X to execute five actions in order: ‚Äúforward‚Äù, ‚Äúbackward‚Äù, ‚Äúturn left‚Äù, ‚Äúturn right‚Äù, and ‚Äústop‚Äù.

To learn the basic usage of Ezblock Studio, please read through the following two sections:

**TIPS**

This block will make the PiCar-X move forward at a speed based on a percentage of available power. In the example below ‚Äú50‚Äù is 50% of power, or half-speed.

This block will make the PiCar-X move backward at a speed based on a percentage of available power.

This block adjusts the orientation of the front wheels. The range is ‚Äú-45‚Äù to ‚Äù45‚Äù. In the example below, ‚Äú-30‚Äù means the wheels will turn 30¬∞ to the left.

This block will cause a timed break between commands, based on milliseconds. In the example below, the PiCar-X will wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds) before executing the next command.

This block will bring the PiCar-X to a complete stop.

**EXAMPLE**

.. note::

    * You can write the program according to the following picture, please refer to the tutorial: :ref:`ezblock:create_project_latest`.
    * Or find the code with the same name on the **Examples** page of the EzBlock Studio and click **Run** or **Edit** directly.
