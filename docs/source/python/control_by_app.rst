13. Controlled by the APP
==================================

The SunFounder controller is used to control Raspberry Pi/Pico based robots.

The APP integrates Button, Switch, Joystick, D-pad, Slider and Throttle Slider widgets; Digital Display, Ultrasonic Radar, Grayscale Detection and Speedometer input widgets.

There are 17 areas A-Q , where you can place different widgets to customize your own controller.

In addition, this application provides a live video streaming service.

Let's customize a PiCar-X controller using this app.

**How to do?**

#. Install the ``sunfounder-controller`` module.

    The ``robot-hat``, ``vilib``, and ``picar-x`` modules need to be installed first, for details see: :ref:`install_all_modules`.


    .. raw:: html

        <run></run>

    .. code-block::

        cd ~
        git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/sunfounder-controller.git
        cd ~/sunfounder-controller
        sudo python3 setup.py install

#. Run the code.

    .. raw:: html

        <run></run>

    .. code-block::

        cd ~/picar-x/example
        sudo python3 app_control.py

#. Install `SunFounder Controller <https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/sf-controller/en/latest/>`_ from **APP Store(iOS)** or **Google Play(Android)**.


#. Open and create a new controller.

    Create a new controller by clicking on the + sign in the SunFounder Controller APP.

#. Add different widgets to this controller.

    You can add different types and shapes of widgets to the **A-Q** 17 small areas inside this controller.

    In the **A** area, add an **Speedometer** widget to display the car's speed.

    .. note::
    
        You can delete the widget you have selected by clicking on it, swiping left to find the **Delete** button, and clicking on it.

        .. image:: img/app5.PNG

    Set the name, maximum and minimum values and units by clicking the **Settings** icon in the upper right corner.

    .. image:: img/app6.PNG

    Set your current environment's ``Line_Ref`` and ``Cliff_Ref`` for the **Grayscale Detection** widget in the **D** area.

    .. image:: img/app7.PNG

    Lastly, add the remaining widgets and click the top right button to save.

#. Connect to PiCar-x.

    When you click the **Connect** button, it will automatically search for robots nearby. Its name is defined in ``picarx_control.py`` and it must be running at all times.

    Once you click on the product name, the message "Connected Successfully" will appear and the product name will appear in the upper right corner.

    .. note::

        * You need to make sure that your mobile device is connected to the same LAN as PiCar-X.
        * If it doesn't search automatically, you can also manually enter the IP to connect.

        .. image:: img/app11.PNG

#. Run this controller.

    Click the **Run** button to start the controller, you will see the footage of the car shooting, and now you can control your PiCar-X with these widgets.

    Here are the functions of the widgets.

    * **A**: Show the current speed of the car.
    * **D**: Show the data of the three sensors on the grayscale module, which have three states: **black block**: black line detected; **white**: white detected; **exclamation point**: cliff detected.
    * **E**: turn on the obstacle avoidance function.
    * **I**: turn on the line following function.
    * **J**: voice recognition, press and hold this widget to start speaking, and it will show the recognized voice when you release it. We have set ``forward``, ``backard``, ``left`` and ``right`` 4 commands in the code to control the car.
    * **K**: Control forward, backward, left, and right motions of the car.
    * **Q**: turn the head(Camera) up, down, left and right.
    * **N**: Turn on the color recognition function.
    * **O**: Turn on the face recognition function.
    * **P**: Turn on the object recognition function, it can recognize nearly 90 kinds of objects, for the list of models, please refer to: https://github.com/sunfounder/vilib/blob/master/workspace/coco_labels.txt.
