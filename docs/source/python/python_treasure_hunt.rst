12. Treasure Hunt
============================

Arrange a maze in your room and place six different color cards in six corners. Then control PiCar-X to search for these color cards one by one!

.. note:: You can download and print the :download:`PDF Color Cards <https://github.com/sunfounder/sf-pdf/raw/master/prop_card/object_detection/color-cards.pdf>` for color detection.

**How it works?**

To understand the basic logic of this code, you can focus on the following key parts:

1. **Initialization and Imports:**
   Import statements at the beginning of the code to understand the libraries being used.

2. **Global Variables:**
   Definitions of global variables, such as ``color`` and ``key``, which are used throughout the code to track the target color and keyboard input.

3. ``renew_color_detect()`` :
   This function selects a random color from a list and sets it as the target color for detection. It also uses text-to-speech to announce the selected color.

4. ``key_scan_thread()`` :
   This function runs in a separate thread and continuously scans for keyboard input, updating the ``key`` variable with the pressed key. It uses a lock for thread-safe access.

5. ``car_move(key)`` :
   This function controls the movement of the PiCar-X based on the keyboard input (``key``). It sets the direction and speed of the robot's movement.

6. ``main()`` :The primary function that orchestrates the overall logic of the code. It does the following:

    * Initializes the camera and starts displaying the camera feed.
    * Creates a separate thread to scan for keyboard input.
    * Announces the start of the game using text-to-speech.
    * Enters a continuous loop to:

        * Check for detected colored objects and trigger actions when a valid object is detected.
        * Handle keyboard input to control the robot and interact with the game.
    * Handles quitting the game and exceptions like KeyboardInterrupt.
    * Ensures that the camera is closed and the PiCar-X is stopped when exiting.

By understanding these key parts of the code, 
you can grasp the fundamental logic of how the PiCar-X robot responds to keyboard 
input and detects and interacts with objects of a 
specific color using the camera and audio output capabilities.
