Video 5: Greyscale Line Tracking
===============================================

This video tutorial explores greyscale line tracking using the PiCar-X robot:

* **Line Detection**: Demonstrates how the robot detects a black line on a white surface using a greyscale sensor, allowing it to track or drive over the line.
* **Python Code Explanation**: Explains the Python code involved in line tracking, detailing the import of modules, creation of objects, and logic for responding to line detection.
* **Practical Demonstrations**: Provides demonstrations of the robot detecting and following lines on different surfaces.
* **Troubleshooting and Tweaking**: Discusses the need for tweaking and fixing the code for better line tracking performance.

This lesson offers a comprehensive guide on implementing greyscale line tracking in the PiCar-X, including practical demonstrations, code walkthroughs, and troubleshooting tips.
