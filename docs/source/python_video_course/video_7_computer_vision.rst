Video 7: PiCar-X Computer Vision
=============================================================

This video tutorial focuses on computer vision capabilities in the PiCar-X:

* **Introduction to Computer Vision**: Teaches how to detect hand movement, fingers, colors, faces, and read QR codes using the PiCar-X equipped with a camera.
* **Remote Desktop and Python Code Execution**: Demonstrates using VNC for remote desktop access to the Raspberry Pi and running Python code for computer vision tasks.
* **Color Detection and Photo Taking**: Shows how to detect different colors and take photos using camera controls.
* **QR Code and Face Detection**: Explains how to switch between QR code reading and face detection features.
* **Object Detection**: Discusses the use of built-in functions from SunFounder's VI library for object detection.
* **Viewing Video on Browser and Mobile**: Teaches how to stream the camera feed to a browser or mobile phone, ensuring they are connected to the same network as the PiCar-X.
* **Hand Detection**: Covers the use of hand detection feature from the VI library and running corresponding Python code.
* **Code Editing and Running**: Demonstrates creating, editing, and running Python scripts for various computer vision tasks.

This lesson offers a comprehensive guide to exploring computer vision features in the PiCar-X, including practical demonstrations of color detection, QR code reading, face detection, and hand movement tracking.
