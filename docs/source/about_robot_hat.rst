**Left/Right Motor Port**
    * 2-channel XH2.54 motor ports.
    * The left port is connected to GPIO 4 and the right port is connected to GPIO 5.

**I2C Pin**
    * 2-channel I2C pins from Raspberry Pi.

**PWM Pin**
    * 12-channel PWM pins, P0-P12.

**ADC Pin**
    * 4-channel ADC pins, A0-A3.

**Digital Pin**
    * 4-channel digital pins, D0-D3.

**Battery Indicator**
    * Two LEDs light up when the voltage is higher than 7.8V.
    * One LED lights up in the 6.7V to 7.8V range. 
    * Below 6.7V, both LEDs turn off.

**USR LED**
    * Set by your program. (Outputting 1 turns the LED on; Outputting 0 turns it off.)

**RST Button**
    * Short pressing RST Button causes program resetting.
    * Long press RST Button till the LED lights up then release, and you will disconnect the Bluetooth.
